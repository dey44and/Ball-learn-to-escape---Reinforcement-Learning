# Ball learn to escape - Application of Deep Learning

## Abstract

This paper analyzes the use of a machine learning algorithm to build a model trained to solve an "escape room" game. In this game, the model has to control a ball that needs to be moved to reach the destination.<br><br>
Model training involves the use of a neural network. The analysis consists of using two machine learning algorithms â€“ Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL). 
<br><br>
In determining the efficiency, the number of generations to be trained, respectively the total training time, as well as the parameters of the model to be trained will be taken into account. After training, the model will be tested in the simulated game environment to see how well it can complete the game. 
<br><br>
The aim of the project is also to provide an analysis of the limitations of machine learning algorithms, as well as the opportunities offered by GAIL-type architectures.

## I. Introduction 

A growing number of AI projects rely on learning a mapping between observations and actions. For technical reasons, learning by demonstration will play a crucial role in the development and use of algorithms for robots, video games or autonomous vehicles.<br><br>
As several computer science researchers have explained, in order to make decisions, humans create specific rules. For this reason, it is essential for a machine to accurately mimic how humans behave in different scenarios, such as video games. Learning by imitation facilitates the ability to perform complex tasks with minimal knowledge.<br><br>
However, specialized algorithms are required to effectively train a model. As we will see next, reinforcement learning methods are limited.<br><br>
Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) is a machine learning technique that allows a machine learning agent to imitate the behavior of an expert to perform a specific task. This is done by creating a competition between two models: a discriminator model and a generator model. The discriminator model is trained to distinguish between expert actions and actions generated by the generative model. The generative model learns to mimic the expert's behavior by producing actions that lead observers to believe they are produced by the expert. During training, the discriminator model and the generator model face off in a competition, which causes them to improve each other. The discriminator tries to identify and distinguish the actions of the expert from those generated by the generator model, and the generator tries to produce actions that confuse the discriminator and be considered to be produced by the expert.<br><br>
Although the networks used in GAIL could find correlations between the data provided as input, there are some challenges associated with training these networks. These include gradients that vanish or affect the convergence of the training algorithm. The difficulty of training these networks is mainly due to the adversarial process between the generator and the discriminator. GAIL uses two neural networks trained in a duel, in the form of a game, so that any improvement to the generator or discriminator involves changing the parameters of the other model.<br><br>


## II. Problem description

### A. Using imitation learning in video games

GAIL can be used to train artificial intelligence agents to play video games at a high level. To this end, the technique can be used to mimic the behavior of expert human video game players.<br><br>
In this work, the GAIL technique was used to create a model that imitates the way a human player plays in an Escape room game. This game consists of moving a ball along a tunnel to reach the destination. The difficulty lies in the low spin ability of the ball, which requires increased attention from the player and great precision in controlling its movement. The game map is illustrated in Fig. 1.

### B. Neural network description
The term "neural network" originated from attempts to find mathematical representations of information processing in biological systems (McCulloch and Pitts, 1943; Widrow and Hoff, 1960; Rosenblatt, 1962; Rumelhart et al., 1986). From the perspective of practical applications of pattern recognition,
biological realism would impose completely unnecessary constraints. Therefore, in the proposed problem it was desired to focus on neural networks as effective models for statistical pattern recognition.
