# Ball learn to escape - Application of Deep Learning

## Abstract

This paper analyzes the use of a machine learning algorithm to build a model trained to solve an "escape room" game. In this game, the model has to control a ball that needs to be moved to reach the destination.<br><br>
Model training involves the use of a neural network. The analysis consists of using two machine learning algorithms â€“ Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL). 
<br><br>
In determining the efficiency, the number of generations to be trained, respectively the total training time, as well as the parameters of the model to be trained will be taken into account. After training, the model will be tested in the simulated game environment to see how well it can complete the game. 
<br><br>
The aim of the project is also to provide an analysis of the limitations of machine learning algorithms, as well as the opportunities offered by GAIL-type architectures.
